# Introduction

Welcome to the netmuncher documentation. Netmuncher is a
hierarchical net list language for electronic circuits. The
command-line tool takes netmuncher source code and
compiles it to a net list file format that EDA software, such
as KiCad, understands.

Netmuncher is open source, and the [repository can be found
on GitHub](https://github.com/jdisanti/netmuncher).
