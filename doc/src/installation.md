# Installation

Right now, the only way to install the netmuncher command-line
is to clone the GitHub repository and compile it. In order to
do that, you'll first need to install the Rust compiler,
the [instructions for which can be found in the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch01-01-installation.html).

Once you have Rust installed and have [cloned the GitHub](https://github.com/jdisanti/netmuncher)
repository, you can install it by running the following
from the repository directory:

```sh
$ cargo install
```
